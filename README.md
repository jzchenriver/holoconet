# [GRSL] Holistic Modularization of Local Contrast in the End-to-End Network for Infrared Small Target Detection

https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10268945

The test code and trained model of HoLoCoNet on the NUDT-SIRST and IRSTD-1k datasets.

For validating the metrics in the paper, 

1. Downloading the dataset.

2. Putting them in ./datasets/[name of the dataset]/images/ and ./datasets/[name of the dataset]/masks/ respectively.

3. Run test.py

If you find the work helpful, please give me a star and cite the paper.

Thank you!
