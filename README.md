[Chen G, Wang Z, Wang W, et al. Holistic Modularization of Local Contrast in the End-to-end Network for Infrared Small Target Detection[J]. IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters, 2023.]

The test codes and trained models of HoLoCoNet on the NUDT-SIRST and IRSTD-1k datasets.

For validating the metrics in the paper, 

1. Downloading the dataset.

2. Putting them in ./datasets/[name of the dataset]/images/ and ./datasets/[name of the dataset]/masks/, respectively.

3. Run test.py

If you find the work helpful, please give me a star and cite the paper.

Thank you!
