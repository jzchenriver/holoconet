# [GRSL] Holistic Modularization of Local Contrast in the End-to-End Network for Infrared Small Target Detection

https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10268945

The test code and trained model of HoLoCoNet on the NUDT-SIRST and IRSTD-1k datasets.

For validating the metrics in the paper, 

At first, downloading the dataset.
Then, putting them in ./datasets/[name of the dataset]/images/ and ./datasets/[name of the dataset]/masks/.
Run test.py

If you find the work helpful, please givie me a star and cite the paper.
